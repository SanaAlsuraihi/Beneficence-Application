# Beneficence-Application
a platform that serves two society groups. One is the donor and the other is the Charity association where the latter does need delivery to the poor. Basically, the donor will need to fill in a simple form to describe and attach a photo of the donated item. The Charity association can then choose what is best for them & for people or families in need. All in all, this platform will ease the transition between both parties & save the charity association the cost of required space & storage.
